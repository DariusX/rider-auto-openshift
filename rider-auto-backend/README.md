# Rider Auto Backend Module

This module is a place holder for a "backend" system of record type module. It really just logs to the developer logs, but you could think of it as a holder for a database or legacy connector.


## Building

You can build this module with Maven:

> mvn clean install

If you'd like to skip tests:

> mvn clean install -Dtest=false -DfailIfNoTests=false

## Running locally
You should be able to run this locally using mvn, and it should work as expected. We highly recommend you test your services out locally before packaging as Docker containers. For this service to run correctly, it's expecting a JBoss-AMQ to be running as well. The jms adapter that we're using in camel can automatically discover the broker endpoint based on environment variables (which is how it will work inside a kubernetes environment). You can opt to run a broker locally and run the broker on 61616 and it should just work. Otherwise, you'll want to set the following environment variables to be able to discover the broker:

```
export BROKER_HOST=127.0.0.1
export BROKER_PORT=61616
```

>  mvn camel:run
    
You may also want to try the same thing using `mvn exec:java`

>  mvn exec:java

This will run the app's main file (from [camel-boot](camel-boot)) using the classpath from maven.

## Building a docker image

FIS includes a supported maven plugin for building Docker images from your project. Unless you're running on Linux, you'll need to install a guest VM that has Docker. We recommend the Red Hat [Container Development Kit v2](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/blog/introducing-red-hat-container-development-kit-2-beta)

For the maven plugin to work, it will need to be able to locate a Docker Daemon (ideally running in a guest-local VM). To do this, you'll want to have the following environment variables set:

    export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://10.1.2.2:2376
    export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/path/to/cdk/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/.docker
    export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
    
Note the `DOCKER_HOST` needs to point to the location of the docker daemon, and `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` needs to point to the location of the cert for your docker daemon.

It would also be great if you had the native docker CLI tools installed on your Host machine (ie your Windows or Mac machine) so you can `docker images` and `docker ps`

### Running as camel-boot microservice

Before we build the docker image, we should specify whether we're going to use [camel-boot][camel-boot] (Plain Old Java Main with flat-classloader) or a Karaf osgi classloader. We recommend building using [camel-boot][camel-boot]. Basically what happens is we zip up the maven classpath and inject a little helper script to run the app using the classpath. This simplifies the deployment so we don't have to guess about which classpath we'll be using; it'll be exactly the same as when you ran locally.

To do this, run the following command:

> $ mvn clean install -Pfabric8 -Phawtapp 

(Skip tests can be done with adding `-Dtest=false -DfailIfNoTests=false`)

After the build you should see the following in the target dir:
  
```  
drwxr-xr-x  6 ceposta  staff   204B Feb  1 10:58 classes
drwxr-xr-x  3 ceposta  staff   102B Feb  1 10:58 fabric8
drwxr-xr-x  3 ceposta  staff   102B Feb  1 10:58 generated-sources
drwxr-xr-x  3 ceposta  staff   102B Feb  1 10:58 generated-test-sources
drwxr-xr-x  4 ceposta  staff   136B Feb  1 10:58 hawt-app
drwxr-xr-x  3 ceposta  staff   102B Feb  1 10:58 maven-status
-rw-r--r--  1 ceposta  staff    47M Feb  1 10:58 rider-auto-backend-5.0-SNAPSHOT-app.tar.gz
-rw-r--r--  1 ceposta  staff   6.8K Feb  1 10:58 rider-auto-backend-5.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
drwxr-xr-x  4 ceposta  staff   136B Feb  1 10:58 test-classes
```

Notice the *.tar.gz file (can also generate zip file by setting the hawtapp-maven-plugin archiver to "zip").
In that zip/tar file, you'll find a completely packed up and ready to run app. For example if you unzip that file, you'll get the following contents:

```
  drwxr-xr-x    3 ceposta  staff   102B Jan 26 08:39 bin
  drwxr-xr-x  200 ceposta  staff   6.6K Jan 26 08:39 lib

```

From that folder, you can run:

> ./bin/run.sh
  
Which should bootstrap the application and run it as a standalone camel-boot app.

### Building the camel-boot service as a docker container

Now that you understand the camel-boot packaging using hawtapp-maven-plugin, we can build a docker container:

> $ mvn clean install -Pfabric8 -Phawtapp docker:build
  
(Skip tests can be done with adding `-Dtest=false -DfailIfNoTests=false`)
  
Note, we have to have a working docker daemon available as mentioned above.

You should end up with output similar to this:

```
[INFO] --- docker-maven-plugin:0.13.6:build (default-cli) @ rider-auto-backend ---

```  
  
Now if you do a `docker images` you should see your new docker image:

```
REPOSITORY                                                                      TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
fabric8/rider-auto-backend                                                      5.0-SNAPSHOT        81d921f951c7        15 hours ago        485.1 MB
```

You can even try to run you docker container as is and map the ports locally so you can see the service running within the docker image:

> docker run -it --rm fabric8/rider-auto-backend:5.0-SNAPSHOT


Note for that to work, you need an AMQ up and running. Continue on to the next section to see setting that up on OpenShift.

Yay! You now have your microservice packaged as a docker image ready to go. Let's take a look at what that looks like if you want to build the karaf-based microservice:


### Running as Karaf-based microservice

We can also convert existing karaf-based deployments over to the FIS deployment model. Just like with the camel-boot option (above) that packages the entire JVM together with its dependencies, we'll be doing that with Karaf. What this means is that your build will _actually produce a completely independent Karaf assembly_ which can then be used to run your application. No more build your app and chuck it into a running Karaf and hope it resolves; now all OSGI resolution is done at build time and the resulting output is a fully baked Karaf distribution with your app inside it. 

Run the following command to do this:


>  mvn clean install -Pfabric8 -Pkaraf-distro

(Skip tests can be done with adding `-Dtest=false -DfailIfNoTests=false`)

That should produce output like this in /target

```
drwxr-xr-x  7 ceposta  staff   238B Feb  1 11:02 assembly
drwxr-xr-x  6 ceposta  staff   204B Feb  1 11:02 classes

drwxr-xr-x  3 ceposta  staff   102B Feb  1 11:02 generated-sources
drwxr-xr-x  3 ceposta  staff   102B Feb  1 11:02 generated-test-sources
drwxr-xr-x  3 ceposta  staff   102B Feb  1 11:02 maven-status
-rw-r--r--  1 ceposta  staff   6.8K Feb  1 11:02 rider-auto-backend-5.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
-rw-r--r--  1 ceposta  staff    37M Feb  1 11:02 rider-auto-backend-5.0-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz
-rw-r--r--  1 ceposta  staff    37M Feb  1 11:02 rider-auto-backend-5.0-SNAPSHOT.zip
drwxr-xr-x  4 ceposta  staff   136B Feb  1 11:02 test-classes
```  
  
  
The *.zip file is the fully-baked karaf assembly. If you unzip it, it looks like a Karaf/Fuse distribution as you'd expect:

```
  drwxr-xr-x  20 ceposta  staff   680B Jan 26 08:58 bin
  drwxr-xr-x   3 ceposta  staff   102B Jan 26 08:58 data
  drwxr-xr-x  45 ceposta  staff   1.5K Jan 26 08:58 etc
  drwxr-xr-x  13 ceposta  staff   442B Jan 26 08:58 lib
  drwxr-xr-x   7 ceposta  staff   238B Jan 26 08:58 system
```
  
Can run `./bin/karaf` to boot up the karaf distro.


### Building the karaf-based service as a docker container

>  mvn clean install -Pfabric8 -Pkaraf-distro docker:build
  
(Skip tests can be done with adding `-Dtest=false -DfailIfNoTests=false`)
  
Note, we have to have a working docker daemon available as mentioned above.

You should end up with output similar to this:

```
[INFO] 
[INFO] --- docker-maven-plugin:0.13.6:build (default-cli) @ rider-auto-backend ---

[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```  
  
Now if you do a `docker images` you should see your new docker image:

```
  REPOSITORY                                                                      TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              VIRTUAL SIZE
  fabric8/rider-auto-backend                                                           5.0-SNAPSHOT        f140fa83fc04        About a minute ago   491.7 MB
```
  
You can even try to run you docker container as is and map the ports locally so you can see the service running within the docker image:

> docker run -it --rm fabric8/rider-auto-backend:5.0-SNAPSHOT

Note for that to work, we need to have the guest VM map port 8183 to the host VM.

## Deploying to OpenShift


To deploy into openshift, we need to generate the correct JSON manifest which includes all of our Services, Replication Controllers and Pods. We can [do this a few different ways](http://blog.christianposta.com/typesafe-kubernetes-dsl-for-yaml-json-generation/) but for this module we use the [fabric8 maven plugin](http://fabric8.io/guide/mavenFabric8Json.html). The plugin basically scans the list of maven properties and will generate a Kubernetes json or OpenShift template depending on the properties.

For example:

          <fabric8.service.name>${project.artifactId}</fabric8.service.name>
          <fabric8.service.headless>true</fabric8.service.headless>
  
          <fabric8.metrics.scrape>true</fabric8.metrics.scrape>
          <fabric8.metrics.port>9779</fabric8.metrics.port>
  
          <fabric8.label.component>${project.artifactId}</fabric8.label.component>
          <fabric8.label.container>java</fabric8.label.container>
          <fabric8.label.group>rider-auto</fabric8.label.group>
          <fabric8.iconRef>camel</fabric8.iconRef>
          
These maven properties will produce a JSON output when you build the project:

  $ mvn clean install
  
The location of the `kubernetes.json` file is in `target/classes/kubernetes.json`

```

            "version" : "5.0-SNAPSHOT",

          }
        },
        "spec" : {
          "containers" : [ {
            "args" : [ ],
            "command" : [ ],
            "env" : [ {
              "name" : "KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE",
              "valueFrom" : {
                "fieldRef" : {
                  "fieldPath" : "metadata.namespace"
                }
              }
            } ],
            "image" : "fabric8/rider-auto-backend:5.0-SNAPSHOT",
            "name" : "rider-auto-backend",
            "ports" : [ {
              "containerPort" : 8778,
              "name" : "jolokia"
            } ],
            "securityContext" : { },
            "volumeMounts" : [ ]
          } ],
          "imagePullSecrets" : [ ],
          "nodeSelector" : { },
          "volumes" : [ ]
        }
      }
    }
  } ],
  "parameters" : [ ]
} 
```
  
We can take that json and "apply" it to a running OpenShift installation. Note that for this plugin to work, you must
already be logged into openshift with `oc login` and have the following environment variable set:

```
  export KUBERNETES_MASTER=https://10.1.2.2:8443
  export KUBERNETES_DOMAIN=
  export KUBERNETES_TRUST_CERT=true
```
  
Then you should be able to run the following maven command to deploy:


> $  mvn clean install -Pfabric8 fabric8:apply

Note for this to work, you must have run the `docker:build` previously. Or you can combine all of them:

> $  mvn clean install -Pfabric8 -Phawtapp docker:build fabric8:apply
  
This command assumes everything is running locally (like on the CDK). Otherwise, if deploying to a centralized openshift
  installation, you can build the docker image locally, then do `docker:push` to get the image up to OpenShift and then run
  the `fabric8:apply` command to deploy the app. 
  

## Deploy A-MQ
This example uses JBoss A-MQ, so we need to have that running in the same project/namespace as the rider-auto apps (including this module).
To deploy AMQ, follow the [instructions from the xPaaS AMQ documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/using_images/xpaas_images/a_mq.html). On the CDK, you can do this:

### Create a template for JBoss A-MQ

> oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/master/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v1.1/xpaas-templates/amq62-basic.json
> oc process amq62-basic -v APPLICATION_NAME=broker -v MQ_USERNAME=admin -v MQ_PASSWORD=admin 
  
Or you can use the template i've included in the root of this project:

> oc create -f amq.json

```
service "broker-amq-tcp" created
deploymentconfig "broker-amq" created
```      
Note that the user name and password need to be `admin/admin` as that's what the rider-auto-osgi project expects.
